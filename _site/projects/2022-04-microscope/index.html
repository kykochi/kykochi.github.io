<p>Adjustable Low-Cost Microscope - UBC BMEG 357</p>

<p>For my 3rd year design course, we were given the challenge of designing a portable, low-cost microscope with diagnostic capabilities in low-resource communities. This project was inspired by a UBC PhD student’s project to evaluate low-cost tests that can detect sickle cell disease in Nepal.</p>

<h4 id="problem">Problem</h4>
<p>Nearly 87% of the world population is unable to access adequate pathology and laboratory equipment to diagnose disease. Current low-cost solutions often result in poor quality images, hard to sanitize, or difficult to use.</p>

<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>We designed a 3D-printable device that can mount to a tripod, and use industry standard microscope lenses.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A twist-lock mechanism was used to adjust for both coarse and fine focus.</li>
  <li>Utilizes common items that researchers would have access to overseas.</li>
</ul>

<p>this design was shown to be simple, easy to use, and effective.</p>

<h4 id="results">Results</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Achieved a minimum image resolution length of 6 microns.</li>
  <li>Low-cost, portable, and can be sanitized with 70% ethanol.</li>
</ul>

<p>We found that our design was very intuitive to use. The</p>

<p>Designing for adjustability was a challenging task in the early stages of this project. Over the course of the engineering design process, talking to our client and consulting industry advisors, we were faced with multiple challenges and were forced to iterate multiple times. This allowed myself to improve my abilities for teamwork, adaptability, and problem-solving skills as the end result of our project was dynamically changing with each design.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the hands-on nature of this project. Spending time in the makerspace tinkering around with tools, rapid prototyping, and the opportunity to work on such a specialized project was extremely fun. It was fun to not only improve my CAD skills, but also perform tests between prototypes to see how we could further improve the design. I also learned alot about the prosthetic space, including the design and manufacturing of prosthetics.</p>

<p>There were a few limitations of this project, which are further explored in our group’s final poster. If we were to continue this project, I would like to evaluate the effectiveness of this socket when interfacing with a real person. This would include the effectiveness of the socket tightening mechanism, an EMG analysis with real electrical signals from a human limb, and how this socket design would translate with traditional socket manufacturing methods (ie. cast molding). I also would have loved to explore the EMG signal processing side of things, which the scope of this project did not explore.</p>

<p>A huge thanks to clients Fraser Douglas &amp; Saud Lingawi of the <a href="https://humbl.sbme.ubc.ca/">UBC HuMBL Lab</a>, and supervisor Dr. Pawel Kuzdia for all of the guidance and support throughout this project.</p>

<p>I was incredibly fortunate to work with such amazing group mates. While it took time to figure out our team dynamics, each person took on an important role that was essential for the success of this project. As a group, I am confident that we can all be incredibly proud of where we finished. It is amazing to have gotten to the tangible, final design of our project, which fulfilled all of our project goals we set out to meet!</p>
