Adjustable & Scalable Transradial Prosthesis Socket

I had the opportunity to design a prosthetic socket that was both adjustable in volume and scalable in size for transradial (below elbow) amputees. 

This capstone design project was done for BMEG 457 at UBC, with four other group members.

#### Problem
Current sockets are often not adjustable with the use of EMG equipment (which allows muscle activity to move the prosthesis), which creates comfort and functionality issues as the residual limb can fluctuate ± 3% in volume throughout the day. The socket is the point of contact where the residual limb interfaces with a prosthetic device, such as a prosthetic arm.

#### Solution
We designed a novel socket, fabric sleeve, and lacing system for this project.
* Our CAD model is parametric with configurable limb lengths to accomodate the variability of limb geometry. 
* Our sleeve can be fabricated into different sizes which cover a vast majority of the population. 
* The lacing system is quick to use, secure, and reliable for everyday tasks.

#### Results
* ± 3% volume change without a loss in EMG signal
* Up to 7kg load accomidation (ie. a bag of groceries)

In addition to accommodating 3% volume change and scalable parameters, we also demonstrated the proper collection of EMG signals, and validated that the socket was capable of withstanding a 7kg load.

#### Learnings
Designing for adjustability was a challenging task in the early stages of this project. Over the course of the engineering design process, talking to our client and consulting industry advisors, we were faced with multiple challenges and were forced to iterate multiple times. This allowed myself to improve my abilities for teamwork, adaptability, and problem-solving skills as the end result of our project was dynamically changing with each design.

I really enjoyed the hands-on nature of this project. Spending time in the makerspace tinkering around with tools, rapid prototyping, and the opportunity to work on such a specialized project was extremely fun. It was fun to not only improve my CAD skills, but also perform tests between prototypes to see how we could further improve the design. I also learned alot about the prosthetic space, including the design and manufacturing of prosthetics. 

There were a few limitations of this project, which are further explored in our group's final poster. If we were to continue this project, I would like to evaluate the effectiveness of this socket when interfacing with a real person. This would include the effectiveness of the socket tightening mechanism, an EMG analysis with real electrical signals from a human limb, and how this socket design would translate with traditional socket manufacturing methods (ie. cast molding). I also would have loved to explore the EMG signal processing side of things, which the scope of this project did not explore.

A huge thanks to clients Fraser Douglas & Saud Lingawi of the [UBC HuMBL Lab](https://humbl.sbme.ubc.ca/), and supervisor Dr. Pawel Kuzdia for all of the guidance and support throughout this project.

I was incredibly fortunate to work with such amazing group mates. While it took time to figure out our team dynamics, each person took on an important role that was essential for the success of this project. As a group, I am confident that we can all be incredibly proud of where we finished. It is amazing to have gotten to the tangible, final design of our project, which fulfilled all of our project goals we set out to meet!
